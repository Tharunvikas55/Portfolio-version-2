Created using NextJs

Next.js is a popular open-source React framework that enables developers to build fast and scalable web applications with ease. It simplifies the process of creating both static and dynamic pages by providing server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR) out of the box. This flexibility allows developers to optimize their applications for performance and SEO, depending on the specific needs of their project. Next.js also supports API routes, enabling the creation of full-stack applications with a single codebase. With features like file-based routing, automatic code splitting, and built-in CSS and JavaScript support, Next.js streamlines development and enhances productivity, making it a go-to choice for modern web development.
